I have written a manual that puts risk management in the hands of the committees that manage the organization's operations. The processes outlined in this document include:</p><ul><li>The creation of a register for the organization's objectives and a mapping of the organization's significant activities to those objectives. This is done to ensure that the entire enterprise is considered for the risks of potential loss and missed opportunity.</li><li>The establishment of a risk culture, not through lectures and posters but: by adding the right questions to decision-making processes; adopting a code of conduct; and adopting a mentality of only ever learning a lesson once; and explicitly defining decision authority.</li><li>The creation of an explicit risk appetite intended to make decisions on risk easier.</li></ul><p>Weighing in at a total of seven pages, plus a two-page sample statement of risk appetite, this process covers a number of key processes from the <a href="https://goo.gl/cxFAEz">King IV Report on Corporate Governance</a>, a highly readable standard from South Africa. It includes:</p><ul><li>Escalation of potential areas of loss vertically and laterally within the organization for rapid response.</li><li>Capturing changes to the organization's mission and activities, identifying emergent risk, and questioning decisions in light of the risk appetite statement.</li><li>An annual review of risk management activities by the executive committee.</li><li>Consideration of the organization's activities compared to its insurance cover.</li></ul><p>Dispensing with abstractions such as risk registers and tedious stilted processes such as "risk management meetings", this is a manual designed for busy non-profits with limited budgets operating in uncertain times. Rather than task a "risk manager" with scolding the organization, it puts the risk management activities in the hands of the people who can do something about the potential issues identified.</p><p><b>About the author</b>: I have written some sixty manuals of risk management policy and procedure for five organizations on two continents. I have negotiated working processes and policies with senior executives as well as external auditors. I have instituted risk control self-evaluation processes and obtained clean audits. I have worked with regulators and contributed to standards by which controls are evaluated. I wrote my masters dissertation on the effective use of risk control procedures. The process manual on this page represents a synthesis of work I've done spanning twenty years.</p><p style='margin: 1em auto; text-align: center'><a href="https://www.simplegoods.co/i/DNPYMUPI" class="simple-goods-btn">Get your copy</a></p><script type="text/javascript" src="https://d3cir4unl8h07a.cloudfront.net/assets/embed.js"></script></div><div class='pure-u-1 pure-u-md-5-24'>&nbsp;</div></div><p style='text-align: center; color: #888888; font-size: medium;'>Â©2019 m. werneburg.&nbsp;&nbsp;michael@werneburg.ca&nbsp;&nbsp;+1 647.896.3850</p></body></html> <!-- 2020.02.09 03:32 -->
